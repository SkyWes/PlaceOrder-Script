# MQL5 PlaceOrder-Script

Place a stop order with stop-loss on the 0% and 100% lines of a Fibonacci chart object. Lot size is automatically calculated based on input risk percentage with a manual lot override. 
1. Add a "Start" label to the 100% line of the fib, and a "Stop" label to the 0% line.
2. Add the fib to bracket the market.
3. Add script to chart. There is a confirm dialog and make sure to enable automated trading.
